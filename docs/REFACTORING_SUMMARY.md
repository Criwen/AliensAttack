# OOP Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The project has been refactored according to Object-Oriented Programming principles to improve maintainability, reduce complexity, and ensure no files exceed 500 lines.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Interface-Driven Design
- **IUnit**: Core interface for all units defining basic contract
- **IAction**: Core interface for all actions defining execution contract
- **ICombatManager**: Core interface for combat systems

### 2. Inheritance Hierarchy
- **BaseUnit**: Abstract base class implementing core IUnit functionality
- **Soldier**: Specialized unit extending BaseUnit with soldier-specific features
- **Alien**: Specialized unit extending BaseUnit with alien-specific features
- **BaseAction**: Abstract base class implementing core IAction functionality
- **MoveAction, AttackAction, OverwatchAction**: Specific action implementations
- **ReloadAction, HealAction, GrenadeAction, DefendAction, DashAction**: Additional action types
- **BaseCombatManager**: Abstract base class implementing core combat functionality
- **XCOM2CombatManager**: Specialized combat manager for XCOM2 mechanics

### 3. File Size Reduction
- **Unit.java**: Reduced from 1275 lines to focused BaseUnit (under 300 lines)
- **UnitAction.java**: Broken down into focused action classes (each under 100 lines)
- **ComprehensiveCombatManager.java**: Simplified to XCOM2CombatManager (under 150 lines)

### 4. Single Responsibility Principle
- Each class now has a single, well-defined purpose
- Actions are separated by type (Move, Attack, Overwatch, Reload, Heal, Grenade, Defend, Dash)
- Combat managers focus on specific combat systems
- Units are specialized by type (Soldier, Alien, etc.)

### 5. Open/Closed Principle
- New unit types can be added by extending BaseUnit
- New actions can be added by extending BaseAction
- New combat systems can be added by extending BaseCombatManager

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused classes are easier to understand and modify
2. **Testability**: Each class can be tested independently
3. **Extensibility**: New features can be added without modifying existing code
4. **Readability**: Code is more organized and easier to navigate
5. **Reusability**: Base classes can be reused across different implementations

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Template Method**: BaseAction and BaseCombatManager use abstract methods
2. **Strategy**: Different action types implement the same interface
3. **Factory**: ActionFactory centralizes action creation
4. **Observer**: Combat managers can observe unit state changes

## Action System

The action system now provides a complete set of tactical actions:

- **Movement**: MoveAction (basic movement), DashAction (fast movement)
- **Combat**: AttackAction (ranged attack), OverwatchAction (reaction fire)
- **Support**: HealAction (healing), ReloadAction (ammo reload)
- **Tactical**: GrenadeAction (area damage), DefendAction (defensive bonus)

Each action follows the same pattern:
1. Validation through `validateActionSpecificRequirements()`
2. Execution through `executeActionLogic()`
3. Consistent result reporting and action point management

## Unit System

The unit system provides specialized implementations:

- **BaseUnit**: Core functionality for all units
- **Soldier**: Human military personnel with class abilities and equipment
- **Alien**: Extraterrestrial enemies with evolution and psionic abilities

## Future Improvements

1. **Event System**: Implement observer pattern for combat events
2. **State Machine**: Add state management for units
3. **Command Pattern**: Implement undo/redo for actions
4. **Decorator Pattern**: Add equipment and status effect modifiers
5. **AI System**: Implement behavior trees for alien AI

## Compliance with Requirements

✅ **No files over 500 lines**: All files are now under 500 lines
✅ **OOP principles**: Proper use of inheritance, interfaces, and encapsulation
✅ **Clean code**: Single responsibility, meaningful names, minimal complexity
✅ **Lombok usage**: Proper use of @Getter and @Setter annotations
✅ **Java language**: All code written in Java
✅ **Maven project**: Maintains Maven structure
✅ **Limited nested classes**: No nested classes used
✅ **Proper inheritance**: Clear hierarchy with BaseUnit and BaseAction
✅ **Interface usage**: IUnit, IAction, and ICombatManager interfaces
