- `run.bat` - Old demo batch file

### Maven Configuration
- Removed demo-related plugin executions from `pom.xml`
- Cleaned up demo main class references
- Maintained proper JavaFX and build configuration

## üèóÔ∏è Current Project Structure

### Single Entry Point
**`AliensAttackApplication.java`** - The only application entry point featuring:
- Soldier selection form launch
- Main game engine initialization
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Clean shutdown procedures

### Core Architecture Maintained
```
com.aliensattack/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Core systems and models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ combat/         # Combat system (15+ managers)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ field/          # Tactical field system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ actions/        # Action system (9 action types)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ visualization/  # 3D visualization (cleaned)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/            # User interfaces (cleaned)
```

### Launch Configuration
- **`launch.bat`** - Single Windows launcher with error checking
- **Maven Command** - `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.aliensattack.AliensAttackApplication"`
- **No Demo Profiles** - Clean Maven configuration

## üìö Documentation Updates

### Updated Files
- **README.md** - Removed demo references, simplified launch instructions
- **docs/inventory/INVENTORY_SYSTEM_README.md** - Removed demo sections
- **docs/architecture/components.md** - Cleaned up demo components
- **docs/SOLDIER_SELECTION_FORM.md** - Updated to reference main application
- **docs/visualization/ANIMATED_MODELS_README.md** - Removed demo applications

### Key Changes
- All demo launch instructions replaced with main application commands
- Demo application descriptions removed
- Integration instructions updated to reference main application
- Testing sections updated to reflect current structure

## üöÄ How to Run

### Development
```bash
# Build the project
mvn clean compile

# Run the main application
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.aliensattack.AliensAttackApplication"
```

### Windows Users
```bash
# Use the simplified batch file
launch.bat
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run specific test
mvn test -Dtest=CombatManagerTest
```

## üîß Technical Benefits

### Clean Architecture
- **Single Responsibility** - One entry point, one purpose
- **Reduced Complexity** - No demo code to maintain
- **Focused Development** - Core game systems only
- **Professional Structure** - Production-ready codebase

### Maintainability
- **Easier Debugging** - Single execution path
- **Simplified Testing** - Core functionality focus
- **Reduced Dependencies** - No demo-specific libraries
- **Cleaner Build Process** - Single Maven profile

### Performance
- **Faster Startup** - No demo initialization overhead
- **Reduced Memory** - No demo assets loaded
- **Optimized Loading** - Direct to core systems
- **Streamlined Execution** - Single application flow

## üìã Verification Checklist

## üéØ Future Development

### Development Focus
- **Core Game Systems** - Combat, AI, missions
- **Performance Optimization** - Rendering, calculations
- **Content Expansion** - New units, abilities, missions
- **User Experience** - UI improvements, accessibility

### No More Demos
- **Single Application** - Focus on main game
- **Production Code** - Professional quality standards
- **User Testing** - Real gameplay scenarios

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Errors** - Ensure Java 21 and Maven are properly configured
2. **Launch Issues** - Use `launch.bat` or Maven command directly
3. **Missing Dependencies** - Run `mvn clean compile` first
4. **Configuration Issues** - Check `application.properties` files

### Support
- **Documentation** - Check `docs/` directory
- **Logs** - Review `logs/` directory for errors
- **Tests** - Run `mvn test` to verify functionality
- **Issues** - Report problems through project channels
