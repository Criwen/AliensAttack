## Conclusion

The current project has an excellent foundation with 35+ XCOM 2 mechanics implemented. However, to achieve a truly complete XCOM 2 tactical combat system, these 10 additional mechanics need to be implemented. These mechanics represent the most sophisticated and challenging aspects of XCOM 2's tactical combat system.

The implementation should follow the existing architecture patterns and integrate seamlessly with the current combat managers and systems.
