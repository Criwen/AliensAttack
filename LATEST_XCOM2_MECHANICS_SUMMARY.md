### 4. Advanced Cover Destruction System (`AdvancedCoverDestructionSystem.java`)

**Description:** Dynamic cover system with partial destruction, repair mechanics, and flanking detection.

**Key Features:**
- **Partial Destruction:** Cover can be partially destroyed, reducing effectiveness
- **Destruction Types:** Different damage types affect cover differently
- **Repair System:** Damaged cover can be repaired over time
